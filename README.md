In conclusion, the Iris flower classification project successfully employed Random Forest (tuned) as the final prediction model to classify Iris species. The project's outcomes have practical implications in the field of botany and offer valuable insights into feature importance for species differentiation. Further refinements and enhancements may lead to even more accurate and reliable classification models in the future.


# TASK 2 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
# Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and consumers. The rapid increase in online transactions and advancements in technology have also led to sophisticated methods of committing fraud. This not only results in financial losses but also erodes consumer trust and can damage the reputation of financial institutions. Traditional fraud detection methods are often inadequate in identifying complex and evolving fraud patterns, leading to the need for more robust and intelligent systems to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real-time.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop and implement a machine learning-based system for detecting credit card fraud. The system aims to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. This will involve analyzing transaction data to recognize patterns indicative of fraud and deploying a model that can predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent.
